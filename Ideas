Ideas for Individual Units:
  Fighting the enemy unit without order if they are too close.
  Running away if there are too much more enemy unit then friendly unit. We can do that by counting the enemy units and the friendly units in a speccified radius, if there are 3:1 or more enemy units will panic.

Ideas for General AI:
  Protecting the Archers. If there are no frienly mlee units in between archers and enemy mlee units the AI will relocate a unit in between.
  The Cavalry or Shock Troops will try to flank the enemy. There will be a special ability for Cavalry that will give them advantage for Charging. They will use this ability to Hit and Run.
  The Shild Bearers will try to block Cavalry Charge. They have the ability to get less damage from Cavalry.
  The AI will try to distract the Shield Bearers with other units before Cavalry Charge.
  The AI will make the Archers run if there are no mlee units to defend except for Cavalry since they will be faster.
